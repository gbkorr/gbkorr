# Profile Under Construction :)

Hello! I'm Gabriel, a Junior at Hampshire College studying various areas in the CS/Math/Data world. I specialize in software and in learning new things quickly--- I love a good challenge!

Aspirations: I really enjoy research, but someday I'd like to work in industry. I find it very fulfilling to problem-solve and get things done.

I LOVE writing documentation, and writing the code itself is pretty fun too :P

Check out some of my biggest endeavors: 
## (this section should have a better header)
[have cute tiny thumbnails for these]

My publication introducing [The Triangular Growth Model], a model for fractal structures found in nature. I did all the code and most of the writing :)  

My R package [rcade](https://gbkorr.github.io/rcade), which lets users play and make games to run in base R. Fully documented!

My game [Banana Brawl](https://gbkorr.github.io/Banana-Brawl/) (one of many!), an old Javsacript project from back in high school.





I love documenting and writing about code! (and writing the code itself, of course)

hobbies? flight sim, instruments (need a gallery of these at some point)


Skills:
Proficient:
- R, Javascript
- Documentation and Guides

- 3D Modeling and Printing

Some Experience:
- Python, C++
- QGIS
- basic server hosting
- basic HPC computing
- basic algorithm optimization with C++/parallelization/GPU acceleration
- electronics and soldering


School:

College wasn't challenging enough so I started spending most of my time on projects and research. At this point I self-study most things (there's a lot of great textbooks online!)--- between that and school, here's a list some of the academic things I've covered:

- Advanced Statistics and Modeling, Image Processing and Interpretation, GIS, Signals Analysis, Pure Math, Bioinformatics, Evolutionary Bio, Anthropology...

But really, my biggest ... is applying my CS experience to these other fields.
